# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithm
 we have proposed a diabetes prediction model for better classification of diabetes which includes few external factors responsible for diabetes along with regular factors like Glucose, BMI, Age, Insulin, etc. Classification accuracy is boosted with new dataset compared to existing dataset.
